                <h3>On Hawaiian Pizza</h3>
                <p>When I was a kid living in a small town in Latin America, I only knew one place for Italian food: La Casa de Armando. He made the most delicious pizza I have ever tasted. It was a tradition to go to his restaurant once a month for most of my childhood years. I liked all toppings, certainly, but I had a special place in my heart for the Hawaiian style. It was so simple and delicious. Ham and pineapple are a match made in heaven.</p>
                <p>For some reason, in America, people get angry about unusual topics. When I was in my country, there was no debate about fruit being on pizza; we just ate food with the stuff we liked, and we moved on to greater things like watching soccer for six hours straight. It’s impossible to type Pineapple + Pizza on Twitter or Reddit without someone weighing in on why my taste is wrong. I never thought more than twice about what I liked to eat, but I read so many insults online about my mom that I think I should explain why Hawaiian pizza is the superior choice.</p>

                <h3>Instant Coffee is Superior</h3>
                <p>
                    When I moved to my college town I was told that the coffee scene was vibrant and vivid. I wasn’t sure what that meant, to be honest, and I still don’t.

                    I have visited at least fifteen hipster coffee shops, and not once have I encountered a coffee that was more delicious than my boring instant coffee. It’s not like I’m not trying to find good quality options. I’m specifically asking the baristas to give me their favorite drink, and each time I’m disappointed. It’s like they go out of their way to make the strongest or weirdest coffees.

                    It’s fair to say that I’m not a connoisseur in this field. I come from a country that makes soup out of chicken feet, so I know nothing about sophistication. But I know what I like, and I like instant coffee more than whatever any expresso machine can do.

                <h3>I Need a Favor</h3>
                <p>Misha: Buenos Dias!</p>
                <p>Sergio: “Hello? Misha. Oh, finally! It’s me, Sergio, I have an emergency, I need your help!”</p>
                <p>Misha: Oh, hi there friend!</p>
                <p>Sergio: Dude, I need you to contact the police and the media but first, I need you to do one thing for me. I was kidnaped! I’m inside the trunk of a black Ford Taurus. The last thing I saw was the Shell gas station on JPA about ten minutes ago. We just exited to a dirt road. I need you to go to my office and hide my computer in your house.</p>
                <p>Misha: OK.</p>
                <p>Sergio: My password is written down on a sticky note under my desk. Once you have hidden my computer, call 911 and the media, have them trace me but before you do I need you to hide my computer, it’s really important.</p>
                <p>Misha: Hello? I can’t hear you anymore, I think there is a problem with my phone.</p>
                <p>Sergio: It’s probably because I’m in the country inside of a moving car, but please tell me you heard what I told you. I need my computer in a safe place because I’m doing an investigation on the Governor and all my evidence needs to be in a safe place. If no one finds me in 24 hours, please give the computer to the New York Times, because the office of the Governor will try to discredit my work and my story.</p>
                <p>Misha: Ha, I’m kidding around! I’m actually not on the phone. This is Misha’s voicemail. (laughs awkwardly). I went camping with my girlfriend for the weekend. Leave a message after the beep. Bye-bye! (beep) This user’s mailbox is currently full and can’t save messages at this time.</p>
